# Google Search Trends Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Google search trend data using Python to identify
patterns in public interest over time. The analysis focuses on trend
behavior, seasonality, and interest spikes that can support
marketing and demand-planning decisions.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time-series trend analysis
- Comparison of search interest across terms
- Identification of peak and seasonal patterns
- Visual exploration of long-term vs short-term trends

## Key Insights
- Search interest shows clear seasonal and event-driven spikes
- Certain keywords exhibit long-term growth or decline trends
- Peak interest periods can guide marketing and campaign timing

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open Jupyter Notebook  
   `jupyter notebook`
3. Run `notebook/Google_Search_Analysis.ipynb`

## Notes
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and insight generation
rather than predictive modeling.
